# Ornith 1.5 35B-A3B Q4_K_M one-B70 patch

This packet contains the lab-maintained SYCL decode optimization used by the
Ornith 1.5 35B-A3B recipe. It is a source patch against upstream llama.cpp;
the recipe and validation evidence in this repository are the source of truth.

## What it changes

Each decode layer materializes eight weighted routed-expert rows and then
reduces them through seven serial FP32 `ADD` launches. The patch recognizes
only that exact eight-expert, contiguous, ordered chain and performs the same
seven additions in one kernel. The preceding weighted multiplication remains
separate, preventing fused-multiply-add contraction and preserving its rounded
graph-visible outputs. Any shape, order, use-count, type, or layout mismatch
falls back to stock execution.

The full-model trace observed 40 matches per token and a net reduction of 240
kernel launches per token.

## Validation

- Raw engine A/B/B/A-style means: `103.047744` control versus
  `108.097861 tok/s` candidate (**+4.90%**).
- Two fresh-server means: `99.664082` control versus
  `104.499487 tok/s` candidate (**+4.85%**).
- All four server runs passed unique-prompt and zero-cached-token gates.
- Same-binary door-off/on forced 400-token greedy output: byte-identical,
  SHA-256 `08f2d1834e42656c85768beef340dda43f35a81924d24a4483613466e99056bb`.
- Candidate canaries: 8x repeat stability, arithmetic, exact copy, and JSON
  schema all passed.

Fresh stock servers matched `0/12` complete response hashes with each other on
the long realistic suite. That pre-existing cross-process instability is
recorded but is not attributed to this patch; within-process stability and the
same-binary door-off/on exact comparison passed.
