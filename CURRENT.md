# Current Workspace State

Last reviewed: **2026-07-13**

## Authority And Update Rule

This is the sole cross-repository authority for the loaded service, active
optimization lane, protected work, and immediate next actions. Result packets
own promoted evidence; lane handoffs own detailed resume context; `notes/` owns
chronology. Do not append experiment history here.

Always verify the actual endpoint, relevant processes, and Git status before an
operational change. A runnable recipe or installed service unit does not prove
that its model is currently loaded.

## Live Service

The public LAN `:8000` endpoint was last recorded on 2026-07-08 as the temporary
Gemma 4 26B A4B Q8 coding-agent service. Its restore, validation, and stop
procedure is in [`docs/gemma4-26b-q8-service-runbook.md`](docs/gemma4-26b-q8-service-runbook.md).
Confirm the endpoint and process state before relying on this observation.

The unauthenticated LAN front door is intentional for this private network. Do
not silently add authentication or change its exposure policy.

## Active Optimization Lane

The active research lane is **maximum single-session Qwen3.6 27B decode
speed**, with a `>=100 tok/s` TP1 objective on one Intel Arc Pro B70 and a
`>=200 tok/s` multi-B70 objective. Aggregate throughput does not count. Use all
four B70s as independent TP1 experiment workers until TP1 is maximized; then
evaluate speculative TP3+draft and TP4 topologies against the 200 tok/s gate.

The target product is one B70. The intended route combines persistent cached
development workers, B70-native offline weight packs, full useful device
replay/fusion, true multi-row Xe2 verification, and the fastest measured
target-verified MTP/DFlash policy. The main engineering target is a strict
quality-valid result above `100 tok/s` on the fixed realistic suite, with
higher workload-specific code throughput where DFlash acceptance supports it.

Phase 0 implementation now has direct MMVQ rows 1-17 correctness at 34/34,
strict graph-off medians of `25.783 tok/s` no-spec and `47.244 tok/s` MTP3,
and four independent MTP3 calibration medians of `47.976-49.708 tok/s` with
all cold/cached-zero gates passing. Mixed-suite DFlash5 is closed as a global
policy at `11.505 tok/s`; preserve long DFlash for targeted code/adaptive work.
The guarded persistent executable-graph cache now achieves exact direct replay
(381/384 hits) and deterministic output parity, but strict no-spec throughput
was unchanged (`25.848` cache versus `25.854 tok/s` graph off), so graph remains
off by default. Native event timing locates steady M=1 work at about `37.0 ms`
(`12.2-12.5 ms` host submission) and MTP3 at roughly a `42.5-45.8 ms` target
verifier plus about `9.7 ms` of draft/state graphs. Standalone MMVQ+residual
fusion hits 128 pairs/pass and saves about `0.3 ms`, but failed the 3% MTP gate.
The first block-scaled Xe2 DPAS verifier layout is closed at only `1.11x` M=4
and `1.09x` M=8 versus vector, below its `1.5x` integration gate.

The larger guarded fusion stack now reaches `50.390 tok/s` strict MTP3 versus
`48.796 tok/s` without direct GDN cache commit (`+3.27%`) across an eight-run
four-card crossover.  RMS/Q8 sharing and repaired SwiGLU/Q8 are retained behind
flags.  Two further 48-layer boundaries are closed as losses: the matched GDN
output epilogue was neutral (`25.89` versus `25.93-25.94 tok/s` M=1), while
moving sigmoid/softplus raw-gate work into GDN regressed strict MTP3 by `6.67%`
(`46.321` versus `49.632 tok/s`).  Both remain default off.  These results show
that launch-count reduction alone is insufficient when fusion enlarges the GDN
kernel or adds transcendental work to its critical path.

Direct GDN epilogue-to-Q8 output projection, direct SSM convolution cache
commit, and fused SSM convolution/QK normalization are also implemented behind
default-off flags and confirmed to match the real graph. The output-Q8 path was
only `+1.00%` in the AOT eight-run crossover (`49.978` versus `49.486 tok/s`),
below promotion threshold. Combining it with convolution cache regressed AOT
MTP3 by `1.10%` (`49.418` versus `49.969 tok/s`), and QK normalization was
neutral. Preserve these implementations and results, but do not enable them in
the production stack. JIT had overstated these gains, so AOT crossover remains
mandatory before interpreting future fusion wins.

A second Xe2 joint-N verifier briefly appeared to clear the verifier gate, but
independent review found its repeated-vector control reread weights per row,
unlike production reordered MMVQ. The corrected exact-production comparator,
including activation quantization and joint reduction, measured only `1.407x`
and `1.374x` on two critical M=4 shapes; a `1.662x` down-projection case missed
correctness. M=8 square passed at `1.925x`, but is not the MTP3 floor. Runtime
integration is therefore closed; no verifier-v2 dispatch flag was added.

Fresh strict MTP3 cycle accounting measures `2.788` emitted tokens per cycle
at `59.64%` proposal acceptance. The M=4 target verifier is `45.646 ms`
(`80.3%`), aggregate draft preparation `9.700 ms` (`17.1%`), and everything
else only `1.566 ms`, for `56.848 ms` accounted. At current acceptance, 68
tok/s requires a `41.00 ms` cycle and 100 tok/s a `27.88 ms` cycle; even
deleting all draft cost reaches only about `59.1 tok/s`. Per-op device timing
attributes `5.43 ms` of the M=4 penalty to projections, but an explicit Xe2
SIMD4 DP4A variant was only `1.004-1.012x` versus the exact compiler-optimized
production kernel. Crossing 68 now requires materially higher accepted tokens
per cycle (roughly `>=3.1`) as well as device-resident MTP staging; generic
launch fusion and another multi-column loop rewrite are closed.

Focused policy validation (`p_min 0.025-0.80` plus MTP2) produced no rescue:
best strict throughput was `50.895 tok/s`, and even a hindsight per-prompt
oracle across policies was only `52.245 tok/s` median. Existing intrinsic-MTP
adapter experiments are tied to a different HF/vLLM checkpoint, lack a safe
GGUF merge path, and their best offline acceptance gain is far below what is
required. Under the fixed single-B70 Q4_0 model and mixed strict suite, the
`>68 tok/s` objective is now blocked by the combination of Q4 weight bandwidth,
M=4 verifier time, and MTP3's four-token ceiling. Meaningful continuation
requires at least one scope change: a compatible substantially better draft,
lower-bit/reduced-weight target, or a context-owned device-unrolled MTP engine
plus verifier below `29.8 ms`; current safe optimizations cannot meet 68.

The context-owned device-resident MTP3 phase-one path is now implemented and
correct: persistent candidate/`h_nextn` staging, ordered same-device input
copies, a fixed three-step submission loop, and a poisoned-host parity/lifetime
test all pass. A SYCL top-k leading scratch entry initially collapsed
acceptance; selecting the exact production-equivalent candidate restored normal
acceptance. The strict cold suite nevertheless measured only `50.164 tok/s`
median with all gates passing, so host-boundary removal alone is closed as a
speed lane. The serialized draft graphs still execute and the `45.646 ms` M=4
target verifier remains the dominant blocker.

Native DFlash is no longer rejected based on the earlier near-zero-acceptance
result. The failure was caused by using Q8_0 for the native DFlash draft KV
cache, not by DFlash weights, Q4 quantization, or flash attention itself. The
missing controlled run—FA enabled with F16 draft KV—restored `100/106`
acceptance (`94.3%`) and `73.47 tok/s`. The earlier Q8_0 draft-KV run managed
only `7/470`, so quantized draft KV is prohibited until its numerical/backend
failure is fixed. A focused 12-case D=128/GQA4/iSWA/sparse-mask backend test
found Q8-K SYCL/CPU parity (NMSE below `6.6e-6`, no argmax mismatches over 960
rows), so current evidence favors DFlash model sensitivity to Q8 K-cache
quantization rather than a generic FA kernel error. The existing Q4_K_M draft likewise recovered to
`104/115` acceptance and `74.01 tok/s`, proving that the original Q4 result was
not ordinary quantization damage. This is the first valid local lane above the
68 tok/s milestone, but it is workload-specific rather than a production
promotion: native Q8 DFlash5 reached only `40.203 tok/s` median on the strict
12-prompt mixed suite.

Complete native DFlash timing now accounts for the mixed-workload cycle. At
`n_max=5`, steady state is about `58.7 ms` target width-6 verification,
`10.0 ms` DFlash block decode/sampling, `1.0 ms` feature injection, and
`0.3-1.2 ms` acceptance/commit: roughly `70-71 ms` total. The measured primary
blocker is therefore the generic small-M target verifier. The next decisive
work is an offline-packed Xe2 DPAS/XMX verifier plus projection fusion; generic
configuration sweeps and another global DFlash rejection are closed.

The first production Xe2 width-6 verifier slice is now promoted. A guarded
single-launch SLM/DPAS kernel offline-packs all 130 Q4_0 gate/up tensors into a
6.069946 GiB BMG-native mirror and preserves favorable-prompt output and
acceptance exactly while reducing target verification by about `2.9 ms`. The
initial integrated kernel returned all zeros because the host packer
numerically converted a half-precision scale object into the raw
`ggml_fp16_t` storage type; copying the two representation bytes fixed the
scales and reduced the real one-tensor shadow error to `0.00036323` maximum.
The corrected BMG-AOT strict suite passed at `39.249 tok/s`, versus the matching
FA-on, target-KV8, draft-KV-F16 baseline of `37.967 tok/s` (`+3.38%`), and was
approved by LocalMaxxing as `cmriq995z0210mj01fl13xmuc`. Do not compare this
identity with the older `40.203 tok/s` row, which used FA off and F16 target and
draft KV. An experimental 65-tensor QKV/Q expansion was rejected after its
paired strict result failed to improve throughput and introduced larger
summation drift. The remaining decisive verifier family is Q4_0 down
projection, followed by high-value fusion around the proven gate/up kernel.

The separate promoted two-B70 vLLM result remains durable reference evidence:
graph-safe FlashAttention plus ReplaySSM transactions reached **95.384868
tok/s median**, passed exact/repeat128/baseline-parity/1K gates, and was
approved by LocalMaxxing as `cmrh35ct50092mj01h7jgydqj`. It is not the active
target configuration.

### Protected In-Flight Work

The following July 12 main-repository work is protected and may be untracked
until it is reviewed and committed:

- `experiments/qwen27-dflash-sycl-b70/`;
- `notes/2026-07-12-b70-qwen27-prior-art-research.md`;
- `patches/qwen36-27b-autoround-int4-b70/llamacpp-sycl-mmvq-ncols17-q4_0-20260712.patch`;
- `plans/2026-07-12-qwen27-dflash-sycl-single-b70-plan.md`;
- `plans/2026-07-12-qwen27-tp1-max-speed-requirements-and-execution.md`.

`/home/steve/src/llama.cpp` is also protected. Its Q4_0 MMVQ ncols 9-17,
MMVQ regression coverage, SYCL graph evidence, and capture-safe concat work is
dirty in `common.hpp`, `ggml-sycl.cpp`, `mmvq.cpp`, and
`tests/test-backend-ops.cpp`. Preserve it, inspect it before building, and do
not reset or clean the tree. Treat the external
vLLM, XPU-kernel, oneCCL, build, cache, and result trees as mutable research
state as well.

loaded service.

## Immediate Manager Actions

1. Keep native DFlash draft KV in F16. Preserve FA for both target and draft;
   require acceptance parity before permitting Q8_0 draft KV again.
2. Use native DFlash as a routed high-ceiling lane; distinguish favorable code
   results from the strict mixed-suite production gate.
3. Extend the promoted offline-packed Xe2 M=6 gate/up verifier to the Q4_0 down
   projection only after its exact-semantics gate passes, then fuse the
   gate/up-SwiGLU-down boundary. QKV/Q expansion is closed unless a new layout
   removes its strict-suite regression. The width-6 target verifier remains the
   dominant cycle bottleneck.
4. At promotion time—not during rapid iteration—record each external source
   tree's path, commit, dirty state, and relevant aggregate patch snapshot.
5. Update the [performance index](results/scoreboard.md) for representative
   verified expectations and the [LocalMaxxing ledger](results/localmaxxing-submissions.md)
   only for actual public submissions.
6. Treat LocalMaxxing publication as part of record promotion, not a separate
   optional follow-up. For each matching 1/2/3/4-GPU configuration, immediately
   queue and submit every new single-session decode record after the fixed cold
   realistic suite, correctness/state gates, `cached_tokens=0`, and complete run
   identity pass. Never submit favorable-prompt, warmed, synthetic, aggregate,
   or otherwise diagnostic rows as records.

The detailed state formerly accumulated in this file remains available in Git
at commit `95b4ca413` (`git show 95b4ca413:CURRENT.md`).
