# Qwen3.6 35B Quark INT8: AOT Census, Localmaxxing Intake, and Runtime Screens

Date: 2026-06-11

## Baseline

Target model stayed fixed throughout:

- `nameistoken/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-Quark-W8A8-INT8`
- 4x Intel Arc Pro B70 32GB
- vLLM XPU TP4
- Quark W8A8 INT8 weights, BF16 runtime activations
- 32K context
- prefix caching disabled
- XPU PIECEWISE graph capture with graph-safe custom all-reduce path

Fresh accepted restore passed the frontdoor quality suite after a prior long-lived process showed repeat/copy instability:

- stale-process failure artifact: `data/qwen36-quark-int8-tp4-noprefix-current-frontdoor-quality-rerun32-20260611.json`
- stale-process speed refresh: `data/qwen36-quark-int8-tp4-noprefix-current-refresh-r4-20260611.json`
- `data/qwen36-quark-int8-tp4-noprefix-accepted-clean-frontdoor-quality-rerun8-20260611.json`
- `data/qwen36-quark-int8-tp4-noprefix-accepted-restored-frontdoor-quality-rerun8-20260611.json`

Clean accepted speed baseline:

| Recipe | Quality | Corrected tok/s | E2E tok/s | TTFT ms | Artifact |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Accepted TP4 c48 | pass | 99.428 | 98.163 | 76.454 | `data/qwen36-quark-int8-tp4-noprefix-accepted-clean-single-r4-20260611.json` |

## AOT Census

Added `scripts/census-qwen36-aot-ops.py` to scan generated vLLM/Inductor cache files for actual custom-op calls and local op neighborhoods. The current accepted cache shows:

- `vllm_all_reduce`: 1364
- `int8_gemm_w8a8`: 1804
- `per_token_quant_int8`: 1368
- `moe_forward_shared`: 368
- `gdn_attention_core`: 480
- `moe_shared_add_allreduce`: none in accepted cache

Artifact:

- `data/qwen36-quark-int8-tp4-noprefix-current-aot-census-20260611.json`

Interpretation: the remaining performance work is not in the old c10d path. The live graph has many XPU INT8 dense boundaries and many vLLM custom all-reduce boundaries. Larger exact boundaries around MoE output, dense quant/GEMM/all-reduce, and GDN projection are more promising than another isolated one-op replacement.

## Runtime Screens

All screens used the same model and quantization. No quality-loss knob was accepted.

| Candidate | Result | Corrected tok/s | E2E tok/s | TTFT ms | Artifact |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| MoE shared add + all-reduce custom op | reject, slower | 99.017 | 97.757 | 76.708 | `data/qwen36-quark-int8-tp4-noprefix-moe-shared-addar-single-r4-20260611.json` |
| TP2, GPUs 0,1, max seqs 24 | reject, slower | 91.247 | 90.118 | 81.296 | `data/qwen36-quark-int8-tp2-noprefix-seqs24-single-r4-20260611.json` |
| TP4, max seqs 24 | reject, slower | 98.888 | 97.618 | 77.441 | `data/qwen36-quark-int8-tp4-noprefix-seqs24-single-r4-20260611.json` |
| `CCL_WORKER_COUNT=2` | reject, startup fail | n/a | n/a | n/a | log: `/tmp/qwen36-quark-int8-tp4-32k-noprefix-cclw2-20260611.log` |
| `CCL_REDUCE_SCATTER_MONOLITHIC_KERNEL=1` | reject, neutral/slower | 99.364 | 98.093 | 76.839 | `data/qwen36-quark-int8-tp4-noprefix-cclrsmono-single-r4-20260611.json` |

MoE shared add + all-reduce did enter the graph and passed quality, so the experiment was valid. The updated census for that cache found:

- `moe_shared_add_allreduce`: 336
- `vllm_all_reduce`: 348
- `moe_forward_shared`: 208

Artifact:

- `data/qwen36-quark-int8-tp4-noprefix-moe-shared-addar-aot-census-20260611.json`
- `patches/vllm-qwen36-moe-shared-add-allreduce-customop-rejected-20260611.patch`

`CCL_WORKER_COUNT=2` failed during graph capture with:

```text
oneCCL: coll.cpp:1421 ccl_allreduce_impl: EXCEPTION: |CCL_SYCL| sched algorithms do not support sycl_graph recording, please use sycl_algorithms
```

Do not combine `CCL_WORKER_COUNT=2` with the current XPU graph/collective capture path until the matching oneCCL SYCL algorithm route is identified.

## Localmaxxing Intake

Pulled public data only; no authenticated submission was made.

Artifacts:

- `data/localmaxxing-b70-qwen-leaderboard-refresh-20260611.json`
- `data/localmaxxing-qwen36-quark-w8a8-int8-refresh-20260611.json`

Public exact-model count for `nameistoken/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-Quark-W8A8-INT8`: `0`.

Useful B70/Qwen comparables:

- `Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B` on one B70 with llama.cpp Q4_K_M: `70.35 tok/s`, ctx8192, TTFT `203 ms`, command includes `-fa 1 -ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0 -t 1`.
- `Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B` on four B70 with independent llama.cpp slots: `68.8 tok/s`, ctx32768, one instance per card.

Our clean TP4 vLLM Quark W8A8 run is above those public decode numbers, but it should not be submitted until we run a longer repeat-quality gate plus a stable r8/r10 speed capture and record peak VRAM.

## Web Research Leads

- vLLM Arc Pro B-series blog: https://vllm.ai/blog/2025-11-11-intel-arc-pro-b
  - Relevant because it confirms Arc Pro B-series is an active vLLM XPU optimization target, including multi-GPU scaling and PCIe P2P.
- vLLM issue 41663: https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/41663
  - Relevant because it documents B70/XPU TP initialization and host-stack sensitivity. Our TP2 did serve, but it was slower for this model.
- B70 llama.cpp tuning kit: https://github.com/Hal9000AIML/arc-pro-b70-ubuntu-gpu-speedup-bugfixes
  - Relevant because independent B70 work points at MoE, Q8 reorder, Xe2 tile sizing, small-matmul, and runtime workaround classes as large speed levers.
- B70 setup repo: https://github.com/Hal9000AIML/arc-pro-b70-inference-setup-ubuntu-server
  - Relevant as a comparison point for multi-slot per-card deployment versus one sharded vLLM model.
- Intel oneCCL environment docs: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/oneccl/developer-guide-reference/2021-9/environment-variables.html
  - Relevant for `CCL_REDUCE_SCATTER_MONOLITHIC_KERNEL`, fusion, and short-size/worker collective tuning. The monolithic reduce-scatter/all-reduce path was quality-safe but not a speed win today.

## Future Ideas Queue

Near-term no-quality-loss tests:

1. Run a longer accepted r8/r10 speed capture plus repeat32/repeat64 quality gate and peak VRAM capture. If clean, prepare a Localmaxxing dry-run payload.
2. Use the census script to compare accepted versus each candidate cache before and after speed runs. Reject no-op candidates earlier.
3. Test oneCCL knobs that do not switch to non-graph scheduler algorithms:
   - `CCL_MAX_SHORT_SIZE` for small all-reduce messages.
   - `CCL_FUSION=1` with very conservative thresholds, only if it survives graph capture.
   - `CCL_ALLGATHERV_MONOLITHIC_PIPELINE_KERNEL=1` only if a census or trace shows allgather/allgatherv in the live path.
4. Build exact microbenchmarks around dense `per_token_quant_int8_xpu -> int8_gemm_w8a8 -> all_reduce` shapes from the AOT cache.
5. Investigate GDN projection fusion where duplicated qkvz/ba quantization and INT8 GEMMs dominate repeated small graph regions.
6. Revisit MoE at a lower level than the rejected Python custom-op boundary. The Python boundary was valid but did not remove enough communication/launch work; a real win likely needs XPU-kernel epilogue or MoE prepare/finalize changes.

Larger branch ideas:

1. Compare vLLM Quark W8A8 against a native Intel/vLLM-friendly INT8/W8A16 or W8A8 checkpoint if one appears for Qwen3.6 35B, with strict quality parity.
2. Evaluate whether the official Qwen3.6 FP8 snapshot's MTP tensors can be used for speculative decode without changing the current Quark INT8 quality profile. Current Quark snapshot does not expose an obvious `mtp.*` path.
3. Keep the llama.cpp B70 work as an implementation clue, not as a model/quantization switch. The user's target remains Qwen3.6 35B, 8-bit, speed plus near-zero quality loss.
